# Componentize login page

Take as starting point 00_Start (login page all in one component):

- Create a component breakdown proposal (enumerate components,
create a pseudocode with the components and detect if there could
be any candidate to be promoted as common component).

- Define components contrats (state + props)

- Start componentization.

- Check which components could be candidate to become pure components.

- Show results.
